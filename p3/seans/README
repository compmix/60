The testhw and the Testing directory are NOT available for use yet.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your gen.cpp source code.
testhw will copy from the Testing directory shakespeare.txt.
It then compiles your program, and runs it with shakespeare.txt as its command line parameter.  
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
